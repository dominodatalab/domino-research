# :passport_control: Checkpoint

Model approval for your model registry.

![build](https://github.com/dominodatalab/domino-research/actions/workflows/checkpoint.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)
[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/domino/checkpoint/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/domino/checkpoint)

## Why

## Quick Start

Checkpoint proxies your existing Mlflow registry and augments it with approval functionality.
So, to run checkpoint, you point it at your existing registry and then access the registry
through checkpoint.

I.E, when you run the command below, you will be able to access the registry
hosted at `YOUR_MLFLOW_REGISTRY_HOST` by visiting `localhost:5000` (assuming you are
running docker locally).

```bash
docker run -it \
-p 5000:5000 \
-v $(PWD):/tmp \
-e CHECKPOINT_REGISTRY_URL=<YOUR_MLFLOW_REGISTRY_HOST> \
quay.io/domino/checkpoint
```

## Analytics

Checkpoint collects *completely anonymous* usage metrics by default.

We only collect the following metrics:

- Count of Checkpoint server initialization events. Collected when you start the checkpoint server.

To opt out, set the environment variable `CHECKPOINT_ANALYTICS_OPT_OUT=1`. You can do this by adding
the `-e CHECKPOINT_ANALYTICS_OPT_OUT=1` flag when you run Checkpoint in docker.

## Development

#### 1. In this directory (`domino-research/checkpoint`):

```bash
# Install as local package
pip install -e .
```

To run the server:

```bash
FLASK_APP=checkpoint.app \
FLASK_ENV=development \
CHECKPOINT_REGISTRY_URL=http://YOUR_MFLOW_HOST \
flask run
```

## Linting / Testing

To run our linting/testing:

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Type check
mypy checkpoint

# Lint
flake8 checkpoint

# Unit tests (only run when AWS credentials present and take 20+ minutes)
# WARNING: the tests will teardown all brdg resources in the target account
# and region, so only use in an account/region without production models.
python -m pytest

# Automatically fix lints
black .
```

We also have these set up as pre-commit hooks. To use pre-commit:

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

The checks above will run on each git commit.

## Build Docker Image

```
docker build .
```
